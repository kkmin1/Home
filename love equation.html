<h2>2. Hyperbolic Love According to Shakespeare</h2> 

<p> Romeo’s love for Juliet, denoted R(t), and
    the that Juliet’s for Romeo, denoted J(t) </p>
<p>The pace of Romeo’s love to Juliet dR
    dt is proportional to her love for him;
    analogously, Juliet’s love derivative dJ
    dt towards Romeo is proportional to his
    love for her.</p>
<p> 
    dR
    dt = aJ;
    dJ
    dt = bR,
    a>0, b>0    
</p>

<p>Romeo and Juliet meet each
    other at the party given by the Capulet family. Since Romeo’s family, the
    Montagues, are enemies of the Capulets, Romeo cannot risk being recognized.
    Still, he is able to see Juliet. Were we to call him at that time, he would
    probably respond:
    R(0) = 1. (2)
    Romeo is transfixed.</p>

<p>Juliet had not seen Romeo prior to the party. Had we placed a phone call to
    her, she would state that her love for a person she doesn’t know is nonexistent,
    zero:
    J(0) = 0.</p>

<h2>3. Trigonometric Love According to Steven Strogatz</h2>

<p>Juliet is “fickle lover”: the more Romeo loves her, the more her runs away
    and hides. </p>
<p>But when Romeo gets discouraged and backs off, Juliet begins to
    find him strangely attractive. Romeo, on the other hand, tends to echo her: he
    warms up when her loves him and grows cold when her does not. The differential
    equations become:
    dR
    dt = aJ;
    dJ
    dt = -bR,</p>
    a>0, b>0
    
<h2>4. extension</h2>
<p>
dR
dt = aR + bJ;
dJ
dt = cR + dJ.
</p>
<p>
If a = d = 0, b > 0, c > 0, we get our original Shakespeare model back. If
a = d = 0, b > 0, c < 0 we get the Strogatz model.</p>
<p> Here the coefficients a and b represent Romeo’s
    romantic mode whereas c and d represent Juliet’s counterpart coefficients. The
    coefficient a is associated with the extent to which Romeo is encouraged by
    his own feelings to Juliet, and b is the extent to which he is encouraged by
    Juliet’s feelings.
    </p>

    <p>Eager beaver: a > 0, b > 0, indicating that Romeo is encouraged both by
        his own feelings and by Juliet’s.
        Narcissistic nerd: a > 0, b < 0, signifying that Romeo is encouraged by his
        own feelings, but responds negatively to Juliet’s.
        Cautious lover: a < 0, b > 0, implying that Romeo is discouraged by his
        own feelings but responds positively to Juliet’s.
        Hermit: a < 0, b < 0, indicating that Romeo is discouraged both by his own
        feelings as well as Juliet’s.
        </p>
