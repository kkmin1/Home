<투표 게임>
Simple political model: 
• Voters uniformly distributed on political spectrum [0,1] (left: x =0 and right: x = 1)
 • Multiple candidates for one office choose platform as point on [0,1]
 • Voters observe positions, choose candidate with closest position
 • Candidate with most voters wins, ties split 50-50
 Check your formalization: who are players in this game?
Choosing a political platform Analysis: n = 2 
• PSNE: x1 = x2 = 0.5 
• No incentive to deviate
 • Will candidates ever choose different positions? 
• No—PSNE is unique
 • Any MSNE?
 NE predicts race to the center
Analysis: n = 3
 • Is race to center a PSNE?
 • No! Individual can profit from deviation
 • Any strategy profile w/ two candidates in the same spot on just off center, other candidate slightly to other side is a PSNE 
• Try to find incentive to deviate. (Can’t)
 NE predicts difficulty of sustaining third party

Median voter theorem corresponds to equilibrium of the “Hotelling” model of monopolistic competition. . 
Producers choose to make identical products, in a model of monopolistic competition with horizontal differentiation. . 
But lack of product differentiation hurts aggregate consumer welfare in Hotelling model, whereas convergence to the median benefits voters in Downsian model.
