<p>Let us follow the basic setup of the Uzawa two-sector model. We begin with the following definitions:</p>

\begin{align*}
Y_c &= \text{output of consumer good} \\
L_c &= \text{labor used in consumer good sector} \\
K_c &= \text{capital used in consumer good sector} \\
Y_i &= \text{output of investment good} \\
p &= \text{price of investment good (in terms of consumer good)} \\
L_i &= \text{labor used in investment good sector} \\
K_i &= \text{capital used in investment good sector} \\
Y &= \text{total output of economy} \\
L &= \text{total supply of labor} \\
K &= \text{total supply of capital} \\
w &= \text{return to labor (wages)} \\
r &= \text{return to capital (profit/interest)}
\end{align*}

<p>he principal equations of the two-sector model can thus be set out as follows:</p>

\begin{align}
Y_c &= F_c(K_c, L_c) && \text{(1) consumer sector production function} \\
Y_i &= F_i(K_i, L_i) && \text{(2) investment sector production function} \\
Y &= Y_c + pY_i && \text{(3) aggregate output} \\
L_c + L_i &= L && \text{(4) labor market equilibrium} \\
K_c + K_i &= K && \text{(5) capital market equilibrium} \\
w &= \frac{\partial Y_c}{\partial L_c} = p \cdot \frac{\partial Y_i}{\partial L_i} && \text{(6) labor market prices} \\
r &= \frac{\partial Y_c}{\partial K_c} = p \cdot \frac{\partial Y_i}{\partial K_i} && \text{(7) capital market prices} \\
g_L &= n && \text{(8) labor supply growth} \\
g_K &= \frac{Y_i}{K} && \text{(9) capital supply growth}
\end{align}

We would now like to express everything in intensive form, i.e. in per capita or per labor unit terms. This gets a bit tricky. But defining:

\begin{align*}
y_c &= \frac{Y_c}{L} \\
l_c &= \frac{L_c}{L} \\
k_c &= \frac{K_c}{L_c} \\
\phi_c(k_c) &= \frac{F_c(K_c, L_c)}{L_c} \\
y_i &= \frac{Y_i}{L} \\
l_i &= \frac{L_i}{L} \\
k_i &= \frac{K_i}{L_i} \\
\phi_i(k_i) &= \frac{F_i(K_i, L_i)}{L_i} \\
y &= \frac{Y}{L} \\
k &= \frac{K}{L}
\end{align*}

Then equations (1)-(9) above can be converted to the following:

\begin{align}
y_c &= l_c\phi_c(k_c) && \text{(1¢) consumer sector intensive production function} \\
y_i &= l_i\phi_i(k_i) && \text{(2¢) investment sector intensive production function} \\
y &= y_c + py_i && \text{(3¢) aggregate output per capita} \\
l_c + l_i &= 1 && \text{(4¢) labor market equilibrium} \\
l_ck_c + l_ik_i &= k && \text{(5¢) capital market equilibrium} \\
w &= \phi_c - k_c\phi'_c = p(\phi_i - k_i\phi'_i) && \text{(6¢) labor market prices} \\
r &= \phi'_c = p\phi'_i && \text{(7¢) capital market prices} \\
g_L &= n && \text{(8¢) labor supply growth} \\
g_K &= \frac{y_i}{k} && \text{(9¢) capital supply growth}
\end{align}

Equations (1¢) and (2¢) are the intensive production functions. These are derived as follows. Recall from (1) that $Y_c = F_c(K_c, L_c)$, then dividing through by $L_c$, we obtain $\frac{Y_c}{L_c} = F_c\left(\frac{K_c}{L_c}, 1\right) = \phi_c(k_c)$. But $\frac{Y_c}{L_c} = \left(\frac{Y_c}{L}\right)\left(\frac{L}{L_c}\right) = \frac{y_c}{l_c}$. Thus $y_c = l_c\phi_c(k_c)$, which is (1¢). The transformation from (2) to (2¢) follows a similar procedure.

Each of these intensive production functions have simple properties. For instance, their first derivatives are the marginal product of capital, i.e. $\frac{\partial F_c}{\partial K_i} = \phi'_c(k_c)$ and $\frac{\partial F_i}{\partial K_i} = \phi'_i(k_i)$, so diminishing marginal productivity implies $\phi''_c(k_c) < 0$ and $\phi''_i(k_i) < 0$.

The production functions also fulfill the famous "Inada conditions", formulated by Ken-Ichi Inada (1963). Specifically:

\begin{align*}
\phi_c(0) &= 0, & \phi_c(\infty) &= \infty \\
\phi'_c(0) &= \infty, & \phi'_c(\infty) &= 0
\end{align*}

for the intensive production function for the consumption good. The equivalent Inada conditions apply to the intensive production function for the investment good:

\begin{align*}
\phi_i(0) &= 0, & \phi_i(\infty) &= \infty \\
\phi'_i(0) &= \infty, & \phi'_i(\infty) &= 0
\end{align*}

(see also our discussion of production functions).

Equations (3¢) and (4¢) are obtained merely by dividing (3) and (4) by $L$. Equation (5¢) is obtained by dividing (5) by $L$, which yields $\frac{K_c}{L} + \frac{K_i}{L} = \frac{K}{L} = k$, but as $\frac{K_c}{L} = \left(\frac{K_c}{L_c}\right)\left(\frac{L_c}{L}\right) = k_cl_c$ and $\frac{K_i}{L} = \left(\frac{K_i}{L_i}\right)\left(\frac{L_i}{L}\right) = k_il_i$. So, $l_ck_c + l_ik_i = k$, as we have in (5¢).

Equations (6¢) and (7¢) use Euler's theorem. Now, it is a simple matter to show that $\frac{\partial Y_c}{\partial K_c} = \phi'_c(k_c)$ and $\frac{\partial Y_i}{\partial K_i} = \phi'_i(k_i)$. So, the competitive condition in (7) is converted to $r = \phi'_c = p\phi'_i$. By constant returns to scale, we know from Euler's theorem that $Y_c = \left(\frac{\partial Y_c}{\partial K}\right)\cdot K + \left(\frac{\partial Y_c}{\partial L_c}\right)\cdot L_c$, thus dividing through by $L$ and rearranging: $\frac{\partial Y_c}{\partial L_c} = \left(\frac{Y_c}{L}\right) - \left(\frac{K}{L}\right)\cdot\left(\frac{\partial Y_c}{\partial K}\right) = y - k\cdot\phi'_c$. The corresponding transformation can be done for $\frac{\partial Y_i}{\partial L_i}$. This is how we convert (6) to (6¢). Finally, equation (9¢) is obtained simply by multiplying (9) through by $1 = \frac{L}{L}$, so $g_K = \left(\frac{Y_i}{L}\right)/\left(\frac{K}{L}\right)= y_i/k$.
