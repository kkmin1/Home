# cobweb.js
This is a simple [cobweb diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobweb_plot) generator in JavaScript, compatible with all modern browsers, and safely running without any plugins, etcetera.

# Run it now
It's currently available at [oak.ucc.nau.edu/jws8/cobweb/cobweb.html](http://oak.ucc.nau.edu/jws8/cobweb/cobweb.html), which should be fairly close to the latest version.

# Directions from source
1. Download at least the `cobweb.html`, `cobweb.js`, and `params.js` pages in the same folder.
1. Open `cobweb.html` in a browser.
1. Fill in the requested cobweb details and click `Generate cobweb diagram!`

# Planned updates
* More code cleanup/refactoring
* Proper themes support (at least light and dark, likely with a cookie to save the selection as an individual preference)
* More example functions (the logistic map isn't everything)
* Auto-updating sliders (i.e., slide to change a value and the diagram is regenerated accordingly)
